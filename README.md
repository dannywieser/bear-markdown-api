## ✨ Unlock the full power of your Bear notes.

[Bear](https://bear.app) is a joy to write in—simple, beautiful, and built around Markdown. But because your notes live inside a database, it’s hard to take them anywhere beyond what Bear itself provides.

This app changes that. It frees your Markdown, giving you direct access to your writing so you can **export, repurpose, analyze, and gain real insights** into your habits. Turn Bear into more than a notes app—make it a platform for your ideas.

> This project is in progress, official release coming soon.
